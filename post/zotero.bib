The text emphasizes methods that are most commonly used in practical application, such as classical inferences for two- and three-way contingency tables, logistic regression, loglinear models, models for multinomial (nominal and ordinal) responses, and methods for repeated measurement and other forms of clustered, correlated response data. Chapter headings remain essentially with the exception of a new one on Bayesian inference for parametric models. Other major changes include an expansion of clustered data, new research on analysis of data sets with robust variables, extensive discussions of ordinal data, more on interpretation, and additional exercises throughout the book. R and SAS are now showcased as the software of choice. An author web site with solutions, commentaries, software programs, and data sets is available"--},

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

We propose a preconditioning method for non-linear mixed effects models used in pharmacometric analyses to stabilise the computation of the variance-covariance matrix. Roughly speaking, the method reparameterises the model with a linear combination of the original model parameters so that the Hessian matrix of the likelihood of the reparameterised model becomes close to an identity matrix. This approach will reduce the influence of computational error, for example rounding error, to the final computational result. We present numerical experiments demonstrating that the stabilisation of the computation using the proposed method can recover failed variance-covariance matrix computations, and reveal non-identifiability of the model parameters.},

  abstract = {Background
Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis is commonly recommended for use, due to its benefits on external validity, in randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). No published reports describe how ITT analysis, as well as alternative approaches, are used in anti-infective RCTs. The purpose of this study is to describe the extent to which ITT analysis and alternative data approaches are used, the practices used to handle missing subject data, and whether non-inferiority trials present both ITT and per protocol (PP) analyses. Results of this analysis will help guide end users of infectious diseases primary drug literature.

Methods
A cross-sectional study of RCTs of anti-infectives published from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014 was conducted. A PubMed search identified relevant articles published in five specialty infectious diseases journals and four general medical journals. Each article was reviewed by two independent investigators with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify results.

Results
One hundred four articles met study criteria. The most common medication classes represented in the RCTs were hepatitis C antivirals (26~\%), antibacterials (25~\%), and antiretrovirals (21~\%). Thirty studies (29~\%) were non-inferiority trials. Most studies (77~\%) described use of ITT or modified ITT (mITT) in their methods. Of the ITT and mITT studies, most (73~\%) did not describe practices used to handle missing data. Most (97~\%) non-inferiority trials described use of ITT, mITT, or both; however, only 15 (50~\%) also described use of PP.

Conclusions
RCTs of anti-infectives commonly employ ITT and mITT. Most do not describe how missing data were addressed. Non-inferiority trials of anti-infectives do not consistently employ both ITT and PP populations.

  abstract = {Purpose. The aim of this study is to define and illustrate metrics for the external evaluation of a population model. Materials and Methods. In this paper, several types of metrics are defined: based on observations (standardized prediction error with or without simulation and normalized prediction distribution error); based on hyperparameters (with or without simulation); based on the likelihood of the model. All the metrics described above are applied to evaluate a model built from two phase II studies of gliclazide. A real phase I dataset and two datasets simulated with the real dataset design are used as external validation datasets to show and compare how metrics are able to detect and explain potential adequacies or inadequacies of the model.
Results. Normalized prediction errors calculated without any approximation, and metrics based on hyperparameters or on objective function have good theoretical properties to be used for external model evaluation and showed satisfactory behaviour in the simulation study.
Conclusions. For external model evaluation, prediction distribution errors are recommended when the aim is to use the model to simulate data. Metrics through hyperparameters should be preferred when the aim is to compare two populations and metrics based on the objective function are useful during the model building process.},

  abstract = {There is increasing resistance to the oral antibiotics currently recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis, and increased healthcare costs are associated with the reliance on alternative intravenous agents. We, therefore, performed a systematic review of randomised controlled trials to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of oral antibiotics for the treatment of pyelonephritis in adults. A search of four major medical databases (MEDLINE, Embase+ Embase classic, CENTRAL and Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews) in addition to manual reference searching of relevant reviews was conducted. Clinical cure and adverse event rates were reported, and trial quality and bias were assessed. A total of 277 studies were reviewed; five studies matched all eligibility criteria and were included. Antibiotics included were cefaclor, ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, loracarbef, norfloxacin, rufloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In included studies, the clinical success of the outpatient treatment of pyelonephritis by cefaclor, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin at 4 to 6 weeks was comparable at between 83 to 95\%. Relatively high rates of adverse events were noted in a trial of ciprofloxacin (24\%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (33\%). Significant heterogeneity between all aspects of the trial designs was identified, with all studies having a potential for bias. This review demonstrates a need for high-quality clinical trials into the oral antibiotic treatment of pyelonephritis, with more consistent designs and reporting of outcomes. There are data to support further research into oral norfloxacin and cefaclor for the outpatient treatment of pyelonephritis in adults.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of adaptive design methods in clinical research and development based on accrued data has become very popular due to its flexibility and efficiency. Based on adaptations applied, adaptive designs can be classified into three categories: prospective, concurrent (ad hoc), and retrospective adaptive designs. An adaptive design allows modifications made to trial and/or statistical procedures of ongoing clinical trials. However, it is a concern that the actual patient population after the adaptations could deviate from the originally target patient population and consequently the overall type I error (to erroneously claim efficacy for an infective drug) rate may not be controlled. In addition, major adaptations of trial and/or statistical procedures of on-going trials may result in a totally different trial that is unable to address the scientific/medical questions the trial intends to answer. In this article, several commonly considered adaptive designs in clinical trials are reviewed. Impacts of ad hoc adaptations (protocol amendments), challenges in by design (prospective) adaptations, and obstacles of retrospective adaptations are described. Strategies for the use of adaptive design in clinical development of rare diseases are discussed. Some examples concerning the development of Velcade intended for multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are given. Practical issues that are commonly encountered when implementing adaptive design methods in clinical trials are also discussed.},

  abstract = {We present an illness-death model for studying the incidence and the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease or dementia. We argue that the illness-death model is better than a survival model for this purpose. In this model the best choice for the basic time-scale is age. Then we present extensions of this model for incorporating covariates and taking account of a possible e ect of calendar time. Calendar time is introduced via a proportional intensity model. We give the likelihood for a mixed discretecontinuous observation pattern from this model: clinical status is observed at discrete visit-times while the date of death is observed exactly or right-censored. The penalized likelihood approach allows to non-parametrically estimate the transition intensities. Application on the data of the Paquid study allows to produce estimates of the age-speci{\"y}c incidence of dementia together with mortality rates of both demented and non-demented subjects. Then the e ect of calendar time and educational level are studied. Low educational level increases the risk of dementia. The risk of dementia increases with calendar time while the mortality of demented subjects decreases. The most likely explanation of this result seems to be in a shift in the diagnosis of dementia towards earlier stages of the disease prompted by a change in the perception of dementia and the arrival of new drugs.

  abstract = {Nephrotoxicity is the primary adverse effect of the polymyxins. The relative rates of toxicity of polymyxin B and colistin have not been fully elucidated, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). A retrospective cohort study of adults treated with polymyxin B or colistin for at least 48 h was conducted. The primary endpoint was the incidence of kidney injury assessed by RIFLE (i.e., risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage renal disease) criteria. Risk factors for kidney injury were evaluated using multivariate Cox regression. A total of 414 patients were evaluated, 220 of whom had CF. In patients without CF, there was no difference in kidney injury with polymyxin B and colistin (42.9\% versus 50.3\%, P ϭ 0.46). Loop diuretic exposure was a risk factor for kidney injury (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.82; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.16 to 2.83) in this population. In patients with CF, polymyxin B and colistin were associated with similar rates of kidney injury (34.5\% versus 29.8\%, P ϭ 0.77). Diabetes (aHR, 2.68; 95\% CI, 1.01 to 7.11), loop diuretics (aHR, 3.02; 95\% CI, 1.36 to 6.73), and progressive care unit admission (aHR, 8.21; 95\% CI, 2.55 to 26.46) were risk factors for kidney injury, while higher baseline serum creatinine levels (per 1 mg/dl) were protective (aHR, 0.08; 95\% CI, 0.01 to 0.48). Total unadjusted kidney injury in polymyxin-treated patients was less frequent in those who had CF (30.5\% versus 48.5\%, P Ͻ 0.001). Polymyxin B and colistin are associated with a high incidence of kidney injury; cystic fibrosis may be protective against polymyxin nephrotoxicity, but further investigation is needed to confirm this conjecture.},

Methods.\hspace{1em} This is a pre-planned analysis of a secondary outcome from a randomized, controlled trial comparing colistin monotherapy with colistin-meropenem combination for the treatment of severe infections caused by carbapenem-resistant, colistinsusceptible Gram-negative bacteria. We evaluated rectal swabs taken on Day 7 or later for the presence of new colistin-resistant (ColR) isolates. We evaluated the emergence of any ColR isolate and the emergence of ColR Enterobacteriaceae (ColR-E).
Results.\hspace{1em} Data were available for 214 patients for the primary analysis; emergent ColR organisms were detected in 22 (10.3\%). No difference was observed between patients randomized to treatment with colistin monotherapy (10/106, 9.4\%) versus patients randomized to colistin-meropenem combination therapy (12/108, 11.1\%; P = .669). ColR-E organisms were detected in 18/249 (7.2\%) patients available for analysis. No difference was observed between the 2 treatment arms (colistin monotherapy 6/128 [4.7\%] vs combination therapy 12/121 [9.9\%]; P = .111). Enterobacteriaceae, as the index isolate, was found to be associated with development of ColR-E (hazard ratio, 3.875; 95\% confidence interval, 1.475\textendash{}10.184; P = .006).
Conclusions.\hspace{1em} Carbapenem-colistin combination therapy did not reduce the incidence of colistin resistance emergence in patients with infections due to carbapenem-resistant organisms. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the development of colistin resistance and methods for its prevention.},

  abstract = {Background.\hspace{1em} We evaluated the association between mortality and colistin resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii infections and the interaction with antibiotic therapy.
Methods.\hspace{1em} This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of patients with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections treated with colistin or colistin-meropenem combination. We evaluated patients with infection caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) identified as colistin susceptible (CoS) at the time of treatment and compared patients in which the isolate was confirmed as CoS with those whose isolates were retrospectively identified as colistin resistant (CoR) when tested by broth microdilution (BMD). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.
Results.\hspace{1em} Data were available for 266 patients (214 CoS and 52 CoR isolates). Patients with CoR isolates had higher baseline functional capacity and lower rates of mechanical ventilation than patients with CoS isolates. All-cause 28-day mortality was 42.3\% (22/52) among patients with CoR strains and 52.8\% (113/214) among patients with CoS isolates (P = .174). After adjusting for variables associated with mortality, the mortality rate was lower among patients with CoR isolates (odds ratio [OR], 0.285 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, .118\textendash.686]). This difference was associated with treatment arm: Mortality rates among patients with CoR isolates were higher in those randomized to colistin-meropenem combination therapy compared to colistin monotherapy (OR, 3.065 [95\% CI, 1.021\textendash{}9.202]).
Conclusions.\hspace{1em} Colistin resistance determined by BMD was associated with lower mortality among patients with severe CRAB infections. Among patients with CoR isolates, colistin monotherapy was associated with a better outcome compared to colistin-meropenem combination therapy.},

  abstract = {Objective: To raise awareness among clinicians and epidemiologists that single-patient (n-of-1) trials are potentially useful for informing personalized treatment decisions for patients with chronic conditions. Study Design and Setting: We reviewed the clinical and statistical literature on methods and applications of single-patient trials and then critically evaluated the needs for further methodological developments.
Results: Existing literature reports application of 2,154 single-patient trials in 108 studies for diverse clinical conditions; various recent commentaries advocate for wider application of such trials in clinical decision making. Preliminary evidence from several recent pilot acceptability studies suggests that single-patient trials have the potential for widespread acceptance by patients and clinicians as an effective modality for increasing the therapeutic precision. Bayesian and adaptive statistical methods hold promise for increasing the informational yield of single-patient trials while reducing participant burden, but are not widely used. Personalized applications of single-patient trials can be enhanced through further development and application of methodologies on adaptive trial design, stopping rules, network meta-analysis, washout methods, and methods for communicating trial findings to patients and clinicians.
Conclusions: Single-patient trials may be poised to emerge as an important part of the methodological armamentarium for comparative effectiveness research and patient-centered outcomes research. By permitting direct estimation of individual treatment effects, they can facilitate finely graded individualized care, enhance therapeutic precision, improve patient outcomes, and reduce costs. {\'O} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

              With increasing clinical emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens and the paucity of new agents to combat these infections, colistin (administered as its inactive prodrug colistin methanesulfonate [CMS]) has reemerged as a treatment option, especially for critically ill patients. There has been a dearth of pharmacokinetic (PK) data available to guide dosing in critically ill patients, including those on renal replacement therapy. In an ongoing study to develop a population PK model for CMS and colistin, 105 patients have been studied to date; these included 12 patients on hemodialysis and 4 on continuous renal replacement therapy. For patients not on renal replacement, there was a wide variance in creatinine clearance, ranging from 3 to 169 ml/min/1.73 m
              2
              . Each patient was treated with a physician-selected CMS dosage regimen, and 8 blood samples for PK analysis were collected across a dosage interval on day 3 or 4 of therapy. A linear PK model with two compartments for CMS and one compartment for formed colistin best described the data. Covariates included creatinine clearance on the total clearance of CMS and colistin, as well as body weight on the central volume of CMS. Model-fitted parameter estimates were used to derive suggested loading and maintenance dosing regimens for various categories of patients, including those on hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement. Based on our current understanding of colistin PK and pharmacodynamic relationships, colistin may best be used as part of a highly active combination, especially for patients with moderate to good renal function and/or for organisms with MICs of {$\geq$}1.0 mg/liter.},

There is however a lack of knowledge on best practices for covariate (pre)selection in pharmacometric repeated time-to-event (RTTE) models. Therefore, we aimed to systematically evaluate the performance of three covariate (pre)selection tools for RTTE models: the likelihood ratio test (LRT), the empirical Bayes estimates (EBE) test, and a novel Schoenfeld-like residual test. This was done in simulated datasets with and without a Btrue\^ time-constant covariate, and both in the presence and absence of high EBE shrinkage. In scenarios with a Btrue\^ covariate effect, all tools had comparable power to detect this effect. In scenarios without a Btrue\^ covariate effect, the false positive rates of the LRT and the Schoenfeld-like residual test were slightly inflated to 5.7\% and 7.2\% respectively, while the EBE test had no inflated false positive rate. The presence of high EBE shrinkage ({$>$} 40\%) did not affect the performance of any of the covariate (pre)selection tools. We found the EBE test to be a fast and accurate tool for covariate preselection in RTTE models. The novel Schoenfeld-like residual test proposed here had a similar performance in the tested scenarios and might be applied more readily to time-varying covariates, such as drug concentration and dynamic biomarkers.},

  abstract = {Incorporating historical information into the design and analysis of a new clinical trial has been the subject of much recent discussion. For example, in the context of clinical trials of antibiotics for drug resistant infections, where patients with specific infections can be difficult to recruit, there is often only limited and heterogeneous information available from the historical trials. To make the best use of the combined information at hand, we consider an approach based on the multiple power prior which allows the prior weight of each historical study to be chosen adaptively by empirical Bayes. This choice of weight has advantages in that it varies commensurably with differences in the historical and current data and can choose weights near 1 if the data from the corresponding historical study are similar enough to the data from the current study. Fully Bayesian approaches are also considered. The methods are applied to data from antibiotics trials. An analysis of the operating characteristics in a binomial setting shows that the proposed empirical Bayes adaptive method works well, compared to several alternative approaches, including the meta-analytic prior.},

  abstract = {Randomized controlled trials often suffer from two major complications, i.e., noncompliance and missing outcomes. One potential solution to this problem is a statistical concept called intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. ITT analysis includes every subject who is randomized according to randomized treatment assignment. It ignores noncompliance, protocol deviations, withdrawal, and anything that happens after randomization. ITT analysis maintains prognostic balance generated from the original random treatment allocation. In ITT analysis, estimate of treatment effect is generally conservative. A better application of the ITT approach is possible if complete outcome data are available for all randomized subjects. Per-protocol population is defined as a subset of the ITT population who completed the study without any major protocol violations.},

With continuous improvements in health technologies, standard care, and clinical outcomes, the incremental benefits of newly developed treatments may be only marginal over existing treatments. Sometimes assigning patients to a placebo is unethical. In such circumstances, there has been increasing emphasis on the use of noninferiority trial designs. Noninferiority trials are more complex to design, conduct, and interpret than typical superiority trials. This paper reviews the concept of noninferiority trials and discusses some important issues related to them.},

  abstract = {The global burden of antibiotic resistance is tremendous and, without new anti-infective strategies, will continue to increase in the coming decades. Despite the growing need for new antibiotics, few pharmaceutical companies today retain active antibacterial drug discovery programmes. One reason is that it is scientifically challenging to discover new antibiotics that are active against the antibiotic-resistant bacteria of current clinical concern. However, the main hurdle is diminishing economic incentives. Increased global calls to minimize the overuse of antibiotics, the cost of meeting regulatory requirements and the low prices of currently marketed antibiotics are strong deterrents to antibacterial drug development programmes. New economic models that create incentives for the discovery of new antibiotics and yet reconcile these incentives with responsible antibiotic use are long overdue. DRIVE-AB is a E9.4 million public \textendash{}private consortium, funded by the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative, that aims to define a standard for the responsible use of antibiotics and to develop, test and recommend new economic models to incentivize investment in producing new anti-infective agents.},

Yet there is no model of distribution ready for a new antibiotic that balances access against excessive or inappropriate use in rural settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the burden of communicable diseases is high and access to quality health care is low. Departing from a hypothetical scenario of rising antibiotic resistance among pneumococci, 11 stakeholders in the health systems of various LMICs were interviewed one-on-one to give their view on how a new effective antibiotic should be distributed to balance access against the risk of inappropriate use. Transcripts were subjected to qualitative `framework' analysis. The analysis resulted in four main themes: Barriers to rational access to antibiotics; balancing access and excess; learning from other communicable diseases; and a system-wide intervention. The tension between access to antibiotics and rational use stems from shortcomings found in the health systems of LMICs. Constructing a sustainable yet accessible model of antibiotic distribution for LMICs is a task of health system-wide proportions, which is why we strongly suggest using systems thinking in future research on this issue.},

  abstract = {Background: Appropriate antibiotic use is vital to effectively contain antibiotic resistance and improve global health. Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) remain the leading cause of disease and death in children under five in low-income countries.
Objective: To evaluate a multi-faceted intervention targeting health-care-providers' (HCPs) knowledge, practical competences and practices regarding antibiotic use for ARIs.
Methods: A multi-faceted educational intervention with a two-armed randomised controlled design targeting HCPs treating ARIs in children was conducted in Bavi district, a rural district in Northern Vietnam in 2010\textendash{}2011. Thirty-two communes of the district were randomized into two arms, with 144 HCPs in the intervention arm and 160 in the control arm. The intervention, conducted over seven months, comprised: (i) education regarding appropriate-antibiotic use, (ii) case scenario discussion and (iii) poster distribution. Questionnaires to assess knowledge and dispensing/prescribing forms to assess practice were completed before-and after interventions. The main outcome measures were differences in improvement in knowledge and practice in the intervention and control group, respectively.
Results: Knowledge improved in the intervention group for ARI aetiology by 28\% ({$\Delta$}Decrement control arm 10\%), antibiotic use for mild ARIs by 15\% ({$\Delta$}Decrement control arm 13\%) and for severe ARIs by 14\% ({$\Delta$}Improvement control arm 29\%). Practical competence for a mild ARI case scenario improved in the intervention and control groups by 20\% and 11\%, respectively. Total knowledge score increased statistically in the intervention group ({$\Delta$}mean improvement 1.17); less so in the control group ({$\Delta$}mean improvement 0.48). Practice regarding antibiotics for mild ARIs improved by 28\% in the intervention group ({$\Delta$}Decrement control arm 3\%).
Conclusions: The intervention significantly improved HCPs' knowledge of ARIs and practice of antibiotic use in treatment of ARIs. We suggest mixed method assessment and long-term follow-up of these interventions to enable better appreciation of the effects and effect sizes of our interventions.},

This paper aimed to assess knowledge of children's caregivers and actual antibiotic use for children under five and to identify factors associated with antibiotic treatment for mild ARIs. Caregivers in 828 households in Bavi, Vietnam, were interviewed using a structured questionnaire assessing both knowledge and practice. Subsequently, 823 children were followed for 28 days to collect information regarding symptoms and drug use. For management of ARIs, only 13\% of caregivers demonstrated correct overall knowledge in accordance with standard guidelines. The symptoms of the most recent illness were consistent with mild ARI in 79\% of cases, and antibiotics were used in 71\% of these. During the 28-day period, 62\% of children had been given antibiotics and 63\% of antibiotic courses were used for mild ARIs. One-half of the mild ARI episodes and 63\% of the children with mild ARIs were treated with antibiotics. Most of the unnecessary antibiotic treatment was recommended by healthcare providers (82\%). Most of the children had been administered antibiotics for common colds, although most caregivers believed that antibiotics were not required. Antibiotics were unnecessarily recommended at health facilities in the area.},

Bayesian model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-ofsample predictive performance.

Methods Women from 18 to 49 years of age with symptoms of cystitis provided specimens of midstream urine, after which we collected urine by means of a urethral catheter for culture (catheter urine). We compared microbial species and colony counts in the paired specimens. The primary outcome was a comparison of positive predictive values and negative predictive values of organisms grown in midstream urine, with the presence or absence of the organism in catheter urine used as the reference.

Results The analysis of 236 episodes of cystitis in 226 women yielded 202 paired specimens of midstream urine and catheter urine that could be evaluated. Cultures were positive for uropathogens in 142 catheter specimens (70\%), 4 of which had more than one uropathogen, and in 157 midstream specimens (78\%). The presence of Escherichia coli in midstream urine was highly predictive of bladder bacteriuria even at very low counts, with a positive predictive value of 102 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of 93\% (Spearman's r\,=\,0.944). In contrast, in midstream urine, enterococci (in 10\% of cultures) and group B streptococci (in 12\% of cultures) were not predictive of bladder bacteriuria at any colony count (Spearman's r\,=\,0.322 for enterococci and 0.272 for group B streptococci). Among 41 episodes in which enterococcus, group B streptococci, or both were found in midstream urine, E. coli grew from catheter urine cultures in 61\%.
Conclusions Cultures of voided midstream urine in healthy premenopausal women with acute uncomplicated cystitis accurately showed evidence of bladder E. coli but not of enterococci or group B streptococci, which are often isolated with E. coli but appear to rarely cause cystitis by themselves.

  abstract = {Disease status is often measured with bounded outcome scores (BOS) which report a discrete set of values on a finite range. The distribution of BOS data is often non-standard, e.g., J- or U-shaped, thus making standard analysis methods that assume normality inappropriate. Data transformations aiming to achieve normality with BOS can be much more difficult than with many other types of skewed distributions, and application of methodologies explicitly dealing with this problem has not been previously published in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling literature. In this analysis, a coarsened latent variable (CO) approach is augmented with flexible transformations and applied for the purpose of demonstrating ustekinumab effects on four clinical components (involved body surface area, induration, erythema, and scaling) in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis from two Phase 3 studies. Patients were randomized to receive placebo or ustekinumab 45 or 90 mg, followed by randomized withdrawal and long-term extension periods. The approach was used together with a previously established novel semi-mechanistic, mixed-effect exposure-response model integrated with placebo effect and disease progression, and with potential influence of dropout investigated. An additional transformation further modifying both tails of the standard logit transformation in the original CO approach was shown to be necessary in this application.},

  abstract = {Accurate characterization of exposure\textendash{}response relationship of clinical endpoints is important in drug development to identify optimal dose regimens. Endpoints with C 10 ordered categories are typically analyzed as continuous. This manuscript aims to show circumstances where it is advantageous to analyze such data as ordered categorical. The results of continuous and categorical analyses are compared in a latent-variable based Indirect Response modeling framework for the longitudinal modeling of Mayo scores, ranging from 0 to 12, which is commonly used as a composite endpoint to measure the severity of ulcerative colitis (UC). Exposure response modeling of Mayo scores is complicated by the fact that studies typically include induction and maintenance phases with re-randomizations and other response-driven dose adjustments. The challenges are illustrated in this work by analyzing data collected from 3 phase II/III trials of golimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe UC. Visual predictive check was used for model evaluations. The ordered categorical approach is shown to be accurate and robust compared to the continuous approach. In addition, a disease progression model with an empirical bi-phasic rate of onset was found to be superior to the commonly used placebo model with one onset rate. An application of this modeling approach in guiding potential dose-adjustment was illustrated.},

We argue that for low-risk trials whose purpose is to evaluate nonexperimental therapies or other measures towards which the medical community is in a state of equipoise, ethics committees should play a more active role in a more standardized fashion. Patients in the clinic are continually subject to spontaneous `pseudo-randomizations' based on local dogma and the anecdotal experience of their physicians. Stronger ethics oversight would allow point-of-care trials to structure these spontaneous randomizations, using widely available informatics tools, in combination with opt-out informed consent where deemed appropriate.

In this paper, a comprehensive framework to regression models is proposed in case ordinal data come out from a discrete choice. The added value of this unifying perspective is the possibility to introduce further generalizations and also to deepen similarities and differences among the proposed models. A case study confirms the usefulness of this general framework. Some concluding remarks end the paper.},

It has also been applied for a wide variety of models and settings, both in the experimental design and analysis contexts. In this review article, we give an A to Z exposition of the power prior and its applications to date. We review its theoretical properties, variations in its formulation, statistical contexts for which it has been used, applications, and its advantages over other informative priors. We review models for which it has been used, including generalized linear models, survival models, and random effects models. Statistical areas where the power prior has been used include model selection, experimental design, hierarchical modeling, and conjugate priors. Prequentist properties of power priors in posterior inference are established and a simulation study is conducted to further examine the empirical performance of the posterior estimates with power priors. Real data analyses are given illustrating the power prior as well as the use of the power prior in the Bayesian design of clinical trials.},

Many toxicologists believe in vitro testing methods are a useful, time and cost effective tool for drug discovery but it is generally accepted that many of the available tests are not effective for examining both time and concentration, and do not closely mimic human kinetics. This is because they do not properly take into account pharmacodynamic actions (what a drug does to the body) and pharmacokinetic actions (what a body does to the drug). Recently, with the use of hollow fiber bioreactor cartridges, this has changed. The hollow fiber infection model is a useful addition to standard in vitro toxicology methods as it mimics changes in drug concentration over time, as they would occur in humans. An overview of historic pk/pd models is presented and the utility of the hollow fiber infection model as it relates to antibiotics and other drugs are discussed.},

Transition intensities may vary between individuals, or with piecewise-constant time-dependent covariates, giving an inhomogeneous Markov model. Hidden Markov models can be used for multi-state processes which are misclassified or observed only through a noisy marker. The package is intended to be straightforward to use, flexible and comprehensively documented. Worked examples are given of the use of msm to model chronic disease progression and screening. Assessment of model fit, and potential future developments of the software, are also discussed.},

In such a case, it may happen that a subject becomes diseased between two visits and dies without being observed. Consequently, there is an uncertainty about the precise number of transitions. Estimating the intensity of transition from health to illness by survival analysis (treating death as censoring) is biased downwards. Furthermore, the dates of transitions between states are not known exactly. We propose to estimate the intensity functions by maximizing a penalized likelihood. The method yields smooth estimates without parametric assumptions. This is illustrated using data from a large cohort study on cerebral ageing. The age-specific incidence of dementia is estimated using an illness\textendash{}death approach and a survival approach.},

The necessity of a loading dose (LD) at treatment initiation has been proposed. A LD of 9 million IU (MU) [ca. 270 mg of colistin base activity (CBA)] was administrated with a maintenance dose of 4.5 MU (ca. 140 mg CBA) every 12 h (q12h) to eight critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy. Blood samples were collected immediately before and at different time intervals after the LD and the fourth dose, whilst pre-filter and post-filter blood samples were also collected. CMS and colistin concentrations were determined using an LC-MS/MS assay. Median maximum observed concentrations after the LD were 22.1 mg/L for CMS and 1.55 mg/L for colistin, whereas during maintenance dosing the corresponding values were 12.6 mg/L and 1.72 mg/L, respectively. CVVHDF clearance was determined as 2.98 L/h for colistin, equivalent to 62\% of total apparent colistin clearance in CVVHDF patients. Both CMS and colistin were cleared by CVVHDF. Application of a LD of 9 MU CMS resulted in more rapid achievement of the target colistin concentration. Following implementation of a predicted pharmacokinetic model on plasma CMS/colistin concentrations, a LD of 12 MU CMS appears more appropriate, whilst a CMS maintenance dosage of at least 6.5\textendash{}7.5 MU q12h is suggested in patients undergoing CVVHDF. However, further clinical studies are warranted to assess the safety of a LD of 12 MU CMS in patients receiving CVVHDF. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

              Colistin adheres to a range of materials, including plastics in labware. The loss caused by adhesion influences an array of methods detrimentally, including MIC assays and
              in vitro
              time-kill experiments. The aim of this study was to characterize the extent and time course of colistin loss in different types of laboratory materials during a simulated time-kill experiment without bacteria or plasma proteins present. Three types of commonly used large test tubes, i.e., soda-lime glass, polypropylene, and polystyrene, were studied, as well as two different polystyrene microplates and low-protein-binding microtubes. The tested concentration range was 0.125 to 8 mg/liter colistin base. Exponential one-phase and two-phase functions were fitted to the data, and the adsorption of colistin to the materials was modeled with the Langmuir adsorption model. In the large test tubes, the measured start concentrations ranged between 44 and 102\% of the expected values, and after 24 h, the concentrations ranged between 8 and 90\%. The half-lives of colistin loss were 0.9 to 12 h. The maximum binding capacities of the three materials ranged between 0.4 and 1.1 {$\mu$}g/cm
              2
              , and the equilibrium constants ranged between 0.10 and 0.54 ml/{$\mu$}g. The low-protein-binding microtubes showed start concentrations between 63 and 99\% and concentrations at 24 h of between 59 and 90\%. In one of the microplates, the start concentrations were below the lower limit of quantification at worst. In conclusion, to minimize the effect of colistin loss due to adsorption, our study indicates that low-protein-binding polypropylene should be used when possible for measuring colistin concentrations in experimental settings, and the results discourage the use of polystyrene. Furthermore, when diluting colistin in protein-free media, the number of dilution steps should be minimized.},

The former assumption leads to parametric models, whereas the latter leads to the semi-parametric Cox model which is by far the most popular in survival analysis. However, a parametric model may lead to more efficient estimates than the Cox model under certain conditions. Only a few parametric models are closed under the PH assumption, the most common of which is the Weibull that accommodates only monotone hazard functions. We propose a generalization of the log-logistic distribution that belongs to the PH family. It has properties similar to those of log-logistic, and approaches the Weibull in the limit. These features enable it to handle both monotone and nonmonotone hazard functions. Application to four data sets and a simulation study revealed that the model could potentially be very useful in adequately describing different types of time-to-event data.},

  abstract = {A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis is important in antibiotic chemotherapy. Basically, the in vivo efficacy of antibiotics that exert concentration-dependent effects can be predicted using conventional PK/PD indices such as the ratio of the area under the curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) and/or the ratio of the maximum plasma concentration to MIC (Cmax/ MIC), whereas that of antibiotics with time-dependent effects can be determined using the period of time for which the drug concentration exceeds the MIC (time above MIC [TAM]). However, an optimal PK/PD index remains to be established for some antibiotics. Thus, a PK/PD model which describes the PK profile and effect of an antibiotic was developed, and the results obtained from this model were interpreted to form a PK/ PD index map to assess the optimal PK/PD index for the antibiotic. The findings from the map were generally consistent with clinical outcomes even for the antibiotics which proved to be exceptions to the conventional classification. For example, AUC/MIC was an optimal index for azithromycin despite its time-dependent bactericidal activity, and Cmax/MIC was a poor index for arbekacin despite its concentration-dependent profile. Thus, the map would be useful for selecting the appropriate PK/PD index for an antibiotic.},

An increasing score (range 0 to 71) was closely correlated with the subsequent risk of hospital death for 5815 intensive care admissions from 13 hospitals. This relationship was also found for many common diseases.When APACHE II scores are combined with an accurate description of disease, they can prognostically stratify acutely ill patients and assist investigators comparing the success of new or differing forms of therapy. This scoring index can be used to evaluate the use of hospital resources and compare the efficacy of intensive care in different hospitals or over time.},

  abstract = {Purpose Antibiotic dose predictions based on PK/PD indices rely on that the index type and magnitude is insensitive to the pharmacokinetics (PK), the dosing regimen, and bacterial susceptibility. In this work we perform simulations to challenge these assumptions for meropenem and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Methods A published murine dose fractionation study was replicated in silico. The sensitivity of the PK/PD index towards experimental design, drug susceptibility, uncertainty in MIC and different PK profiles was evaluated.
Results The previous murine study data were well replicated with fT {$>$} MIC selected as the best predictor. However, for increased dosing frequencies fAUC/MIC was found to be more predictive and the magnitude of the index was sensitive to drug susceptibility. With human PK fT {$>$} MIC and fAUC/ MIC had similar predictive capacities with preference for fT {$>$} MIC when short t1/2 and fAUC/MIC when long t1/2.
Conclusions A longitudinal PKPD model based on in vitro data successfully predicted a previous in vivo study of meropenem. The type and magnitude of the PK/PD index were sensitive to the experimental design, the MIC and the PK. Therefore, it may be preferable to perform simulations for dose selection based on an integrated PK-PKPD model rather than using a fixed PK/PD index target.},

Although there has been extensive research in the area of fixed effects models, much less attention has been paid to random effects models. In this context we distinguish between theoretical identifiability, in which different parameter values lead to non-identical probability distributions, structural identifiability which concerns the algebraic properties of the structural model, and practical identifiability, whereby the model may be theoretically identifiable but the design of the experiment may make parameter estimation difficult and imprecise. We explore a number of pharmacokinetic models which are known to be non-identifiable at an individual level but can become identifiable at the population level if a number of specific assumptions on the probabilistic model hold. Essentially if the probabilistic models are different, even though the structural models are non-identifiable, then they will lead to different likelihoods. The findings are supported through simulations.},

  abstract = {Background: Serum creatinine concentration is widely used as an index of renal function, but this concentration is affected by factors other than glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
Objective: To develop an equation to predict GFR from serum creatinine concentration and other factors. Design: Cross-sectional study of GFR, creatinine clearance, serum creatinine concentration, and demographic and clinical characteristics in patients with chronic renal disease. Patients: 1628 patients enrolled in the baseline period of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study, of whom 1070 were randomly selected as the training sample; the remaining 558 patients constituted the validation sample.
Methods: The prediction equation was developed by stepwise regression applied to the training sample. The equation was then tested and compared with other prediction equations in the validation sample.
Results: To simplify prediction of GFR, the equation included only demographic and serum variables. Independent factors associated with a lower GFR included a higher serum creatinine concentration, older age, female sex, nonblack ethnicity, higher serum urea nitrogen levels, and lower serum albumin levels (P Ͻ 0.001 for all factors). The multiple regression model explained 90.3\% of the variance in the logarithm of GFR in the validation sample. Measured creatinine clearance overestimated GFR by 19\%, and creatinine clearance predicted by the Cockcroft\textendash{}Gault formula overestimated GFR by 16\%. After adjustment for this overestimation, the percentage of variance of the logarithm of GFR predicted by measured creatinine clearance or the Cockcroft\textendash{}Gault formula was 86.6\% and 84.2\%, respectively.

  abstract = {Background\textemdash{}Equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are routinely used to assess kidney function. Current equations have limited precision and systematically underestimate measured GFR at higher levels.
Objective\textemdash{}To develop a new estimating equation (CKD-EPI creatinine equation). Design\textemdash{}Cross-sectional analysis. Separate pooled databases for equation development and validation. Representative U.S. population for prevalence estimates. Setting\textemdash{}Research studies and clinical populations (``studies'') with measured GFR. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2006. Patients\textemdash{}Equation development in 10 studies (8254 people) and validation in 16 studies (3896 people). Prevalence estimates based on 16,032 people.
Measurements\textemdash{}GFR measured as the clearance of exogenous filtration markers (iothalamate in the development dataset; iothalamate and other markers in the validation dataset). Linear regression to estimate the logarithm of measured GFR from standardized creatinine, sex, race and age.
Results\textemdash{}In the validation dataset, the CKD-EPI performed better than the MDRD Study equation (p{$<$}0.001 for all subsequent comparisons), especially at higher GFR: lesser bias (median difference between measured and estimated GFR of 2.5 vs. 5.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively); improved precision (interquartile range of the differences of 16.6 vs. 18.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively); and greater accuracy (percent of estimated GFR within 30\% of measured GFR of 84.1 vs. 80.6\%, respectively. In NHANES, median (interquartile range) estimated GFR was 94.5 (79.7 \textendash{} 108.1) vs. 85.0 (72.9 \textendash{} 98.5) mL/min/1.73 m2, and the prevalence (95\% confidence interval) of CKD was 11.5 (10.6, 12.4) \% vs. 13.1 (12.1, 14.0) \%, respectively. Limitations\textemdash{}Limited number of elderly people and racial and ethnic minorities with measured GFR.
Conclusions\textemdash{}The CKD-EPI creatinine equation is more accurate than the MDRD Study equation and could replace it for routine clinical use.},

  abstract = {Augmented renal clearance (ARC) is a manifestation of enhanced renal function seen in critically ill patients. The use of regular unadjusted doses of renally eliminated drugs in patients with ARC might lead to therapy failure. The purpose of this scoping review was to provide and up-to-date summary of the available evidence pertaining to the phenomenon of ARC. A literature search of databases of available evidence in humans, with no language restriction, was conducted. Databases searched were MEDLINE (1946 to April 2017), EMBASE (1974 to April 2017) and the Cochrane Library (1999 to April 2017). A total of 57 records were included in the present review: 39 observational studies (25 prospective, 14 retrospective), 6 case reports/series and 12 conference abstracts. ARC has been reported to range from 14 to 80\%. ARC is currently defined as an increased creatinine clearance of greater than 130 mL/min/1.73 m2 best measured by 8\textendash{}24 h urine collection. Patients exhibiting ARC tend to be younger ({$<$}50 years old), of male gender, had a recent history of trauma, and had lower critical illness severity scores. Numerous studies have reported antimicrobials treatment failures when using standard dosing regimens in patients with ARC. In conclusion, ARC is an important phenomenon that might have significant impact on outcome in critically ill patients. Identifying patients at risk, using higher doses of renally eliminated drugs or use of non-renally eliminated alternatives might need to be considered in ICU patients with ARC. More research is needed to solidify dosing recommendations of various drugs in patients with ARC.},

CARE was a phase 3, open-label study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of PLZ in patients with infections due to CRE. The aim of this exploratory analysis was to evaluate outcomes in the subgroup with CRE BSI.
Methods.\hspace{1em} CARE enrolled 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 (C1), a randomized comparison of PLZ vs. CST and Cohort 2 (C2), a single-arm study of PLZ in patients ineligible for C1. Patients in C1 received PLZ (15 mg/kg q24h) or CST (300-mg load [colistin base activity] then 5 mg/kg/d) plus tigecycline or meropenem. Patients in C2 received PLZ plus investigator's choice of adjunctive agent. Treatment was 7\textendash{}14 days. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality (ACM) at Day 28 or significant disease-related complications (SDRCs) in patients with confirmed CRE who received {$\geq$}1 dose of study drug (mMITT population). Clearance of bacteremia by Day 5 required 2 negative cultures {$\geq$}24 hours apart with sustained clearance through the study period. Serum creatinine levels were assessed by a central lab.
Results.\hspace{1em} Of 39 patients enrolled in C1, 30 had BSI (29 mMITT). PLZ patients had lower ACM at Day 28 or SDRCs and ACM at Day 28 compared with CST patients and higher rates of bacteremia clearance by Day 5 (Table). Lack of clearance in PLZ patients was due to recurrence beyond Day 5 (1 pt) and insufficient follow-up to demonstrate clearance (1 pt); 6 CST patients failed to clear by Day 5 and 2 had recurrence beyond Day 5. 10\%(1/10) of PLZ and 25\% (3/12) of CST patients experienced a {$\geq$}0.5 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine from baseline through the end of therapy. Of 30 patients enrolled in C2, 15 had BSI (14 mMITT). ACM at Day 28 or SDRCs and ACM at Day 28 were 35.7\% (5/14) and 14.3\% (2/14), respectively. Clearance of bacteremia at Day 5 was observed in 64.3\% (9/14); of the 5 whose bacteremia did not clear, 1 failed to clear by Day 5 and 4 had recurrence beyond Day 5. A {$\geq$}0.5 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine through the end of therapy was reported in 33.3\% (4/12).
Conclusion.\hspace{1em} PLZ was associated with improved survival and microbiological clearance compared with CST in C1 patients with BSI; outcomes in C2 were supportive of these findings. PLZ may be an important potential new treatment option for patients with CRE BSI.},

This is a particular challenge for low and middle-income countries with pluralistic health systems where antibiotics are available in a number of different markets. This review paper considers access and use of antibiotics in these countries from a complex adaptive system perspective. It highlights the main areas of intervention that could provide the key to addressing the sustainable long term use and availability of antibiotics. A focus on the synergies between interventions addressing access strategies, antibiotic quality, diagnostics for lowresource settings, measures to encourage just and sustainable decision making and help seeking optimal therapeutic and dosing strategies are key levers for the sustainable future of antibiotic use. Successful integration of such strategies will be dependent on effective governance mechanisms, effective partnerships and coalition building and accurate evaluation systems at national, regional and global levels.},

  abstract = {1. Creatinine metabolism was studied in nine patients with severe chronic renal failure who were nevertheless in a nearly steady state with respect to their creatinine pool. Labelled creatinine was injected intravenously and the specific radioactivity of creatinine in urine was measured during the ensuing 5\textendash{}7 days.
            2. In each patient, the decline in specific radioactivity with time was a single exponential function after 12 h. The volume of distribution of creatinine averaged 49.1 {$\pm$} 2.8\% body weight. The average rate of creatinine production was 148 {$\mu$}mol day-1 kg-1, which is similar to predicted values for normal subjects of the same age, weight and sex. Creatinine metabolism rate/kg body weight, estimated as the difference between production rate/kg body weight, determined radioisotopically, and creatinine appearance rate (excretion plus accumulation), averaged 42 {$\mu$}mol day-1 kg-1.
            3. Total creatinine metabolism rate/kg body weight was correlated with serum creatinine. Thus, as serum creatinine rises, an increasing fraction of the produced creatinine was metabolized rather than excreted. This relationship could account for the diminished creatinine excretion commonly seen in patients with chronic renal failure.
            4. Extrarenal clearance (metabolism/serum creatinine) of this magnitude (approximately 31\% of renal clearance in these patients) would be an undetectably small fraction of normal renal clearance. This could explain the absence of demonstrable creatinine metabolism in normal subjects.
            5. Two pathways of metabolism were identified: a recycling of creatinine to creatine and an irreversible degradation of creatinine to products other than creatine.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Combination therapy can be a strategy to ensure effective bacterial killing when treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium with high potential for developing resistance. The aim of this study was to develop a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model that describes the in vitro bacterial time \textendash{} kill curves of colistin and meropenem alone and in combination for one WT and one meropenemresistant strain of P. aeruginosa.
Methods: In vitro time \textendash{} kill curve experiments were conducted with a P. aeruginosa WT (ATCC 27853) (MICs: meropenem 1 mg/L; colistin 1 mg/L) and a meropenem-resistant type (ARU552) (MICs: meropenem 16 mg/L; colistin 1.5 mg/L). PK/PD models characterizing resistance were fitted to the observed bacterial counts in NONMEM. The final model was applied to predict the bacterial killing of ARU552 for different combination dosages of colistin and meropenem.
Results: A model with compartments for growing and resting bacteria, where the bacterial killing by colistin reduced with continued exposure and a small fraction (0.15\%) of the start inoculum was resistant to meropenem, characterized the bactericidal effect and resistance development of the two antibiotics. For a typical patient, a loading dose of colistin combined with a high dose of meropenem (2000 mg q8h) was predicted to result in a pronounced kill of the meropenem-resistant strain over 24 h.
Conclusions: The developed PK/PD model successfully described the time course of bacterial counts following exposures to colistin and meropenem, alone and in combination, for both strains, and identified a dynamic drug interaction. The study illustrates the application of a PK/PD model and supports high-dose combination therapy of colistin and meropenem to overcome meropenem resistance.},

The objectives of this study were to develop a pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) model that characterizes the time course of the antibacterial activity of colistin against P. aeruginosa in a static in vitro system and to perform simulations of different dosing regimens and dosing algorithms to evaluate the effect of interindividual variability and interoccasion variability in PK on bacterial killing.
Methods: Static in vitro time \textendash{}kill curve experiments were conducted on two different strains of P. aeruginosa (MIC 1 and 1.5 mg/L). Mechanism-based PK/PD models were fitted in NONMEM7 and the final model was combined with a previously developed population PK model of CMS and colistin to perform simulations of variability based on different dosing algorithms.
Results: A model with compartments for growing and resting bacteria, with a function allowing the maximal bacterial killing of colistin to reduce upon increasing colistin exposure, characterized both the fast bactericidal effect and the adaptive resistance. The variability in PK was shown to translate into pronounced interoccasion variability in bacterial killing. A flat fixed loading dose was demonstrated to result in less variability than an algorithm based on weight.
Conclusions: The developed PK/PD model described the growth, death and resistance development of P. aeruginosa in response to colistin for two different strains. Based on simulations, a flat fixed loading dose followed by an 8 or 12 hourly maintenance dose with an infusion duration of up to 2 h appeared adequate.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Although testing of antimicrobial agents for susceptibility has inherent variability like any assay, it is generally held that there are also real differences in susceptibility between strains. In the routine laboratory, variability of the MIC measurement may be sufficient to mask real strain differences. We determined which factors contributed to the variability, using linezolid against Staphylococcus aureus as one example.
Methods: Twenty-five S. aureus strains were sent to five different laboratories in quadruplicate in a blinded fashion. Laboratories determined MICs of linezolid using Etest. Results of 22 strains corresponding to 440 observations were available for analysis. Sources of variability were explored and quantified using an ANOVA approach.
Results: The overall geometric mean MIC was 1.8 mg/L, comparable to that of the published WT distribution of 1.7 mg/L (www.eucast.org). The total variation amounted to  1.3 2-fold dilutions for a one-sided CI of 95\% and two 2-fold dilutions for a CI of 99\%. Variation between laboratories and variation between strains contributed 10\% and 48\%, and in a subset analysis averaging 17\% and 26\%, respectively. Strain-to-strain variation (biological variation) could not be reliably determined, even with four replicates.
Conclusions: This analysis serves as an example of an approach to discerning various sources of MIC variation. Here, at best, a single measurement of an MIC may provide an indication of whether it likely belongs to the WT distribution. Only repeated measurements of MICs for individual strains within one laboratory may provide an indication of differences in susceptibility between strains.},

Many of these old antibiotics were approved long ago, in an era when there was no clear process for development, and requirements for efficacy to be demonstrated in rigorous clinical trials did not exist. At the time of these approvals, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles were largely unknown, and did not inform the dose-finding process or recommendations for optimal usage. Indeed, the task of generating basic vital information for these old antibiotics remains to be performed. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the most essential data needed for dose justification and optimization. An overview of the shortage of data for selected old antibiotics illustrates the scope of the problem. In order to prevent harming patients with clinical decisions based on inadequate evidence, a redevelopment procedure for old antibiotics is urgently needed, including a regulatory framework.},

  abstract = {Background.\hspace{1em} Intravenous colistin is difficult to use because plasma concentrations for antibacterial effect overlap those causing nephrotoxicity, and there is large interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics. The aim was to develop dosing algorithms for achievement of a clinically desirable average steady-state plasma colistin concentration (Css,avg) of 2 mg/L.
Methods.\hspace{1em} Plasma concentration-time data from 214 adult critically ill patients (creatinine clearance, 0\textendash{}236 mL/min; 29 receiving renal replacement therapy [RRT]) were subjected to population pharmacokinetic analysis. Development of an algorithm for patients not receiving RRT was based on the relationship between the dose of colistimethate that would be needed to achieve a desired Css,avg and creatinine clearance. The increase in colistin clearance when patients were receiving RRT was determined from the population analysis and guided the supplemental dosing needed. To balance potential antibacterial benefit against risk of nephrotoxicity the algorithms were designed to achieve target attainment rates of {$>$}80\% for Css,avg {$\geq$}2 and {$<$}30\% for Css,avg {$\geq$}4 mg/L.
Results.\hspace{1em} When algorithm doses were applied back to individual patients not receiving RRT (including those prescribed intermittent dialysis on a nondialysis day), {$>$}80\% of patients with creatinine clearance {$<$}80 mL/min achieved Css,avg {$\geq$}2 mg/L, but for patients with creatinine clearance {$\geq$}80 mL/min, the target attainment was {$<$}40\%, even with the maximum allowed daily dose of 360 mg colistin base activity. For patients receiving RRT, target attainment rates were {$>$}80\% with the proposed supplemental dosing. In all categories of patients, {$<$}30\% of patients attained Css,avg {$\geq$}4 mg/L.
Conclusions.\hspace{1em} The project has generated clinician-friendly dosing algorithms and pointed to circumstances in which intravenous monotherapy may be inadequate.},

  abstract = {Adaptive designs can make clinical trials more flexible by utilising results accumulating in the trial to modify the trial's course in accordance with pre-specified rules. Trials with an adaptive design are often more efficient, informative and ethical than trials with a traditional fixed design since they often make better use of resources such as time and money, and might require fewer participants. Adaptive designs can be applied across all phases of clinical research, from early-phase dose escalation to confirmatory trials. The pace of the uptake of adaptive designs in clinical research, however, has remained well behind that of the statistical literature introducing new methods and highlighting their potential advantages. We speculate that one factor contributing to this is that the full range of adaptations available to trial designs, as well as their goals, advantages and limitations, remains unfamiliar to many parts of the clinical community. Additionally, the term adaptive design has been misleadingly used as an all-encompassing label to refer to certain methods that could be deemed controversial or that have been inadequately implemented. We believe that even if the planning and analysis of a trial is undertaken by an expert statistician, it is essential that the investigators understand the implications of using an adaptive design, for example, what the practical challenges are, what can (and cannot) be inferred from the results of such a trial, and how to report and communicate the results. This tutorial paper provides guidance on key aspects of adaptive designs that are relevant to clinical triallists. We explain the basic rationale behind adaptive designs, clarify ambiguous terminology and summarise the utility and pitfalls of adaptive designs. We discuss practical aspects around funding, ethical approval, treatment supply and communication with stakeholders and trial participants. Our focus, however, is on the interpretation and reporting of results from adaptive design trials, which we consider vital for anyone involved in medical research. We emphasise the general principles of transparency and reproducibility and suggest how best to put them into practice.},

  abstract = {Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (CR-GNB) represent an increasing hazard in healthcare settings. A central question concerning the treatment of invasive infections caused by CR-GNB involves the use of combination therapy. Potential advantages of combination therapy include improved efficacy due to synergy, while the disadvantages include adverse events and increased antibiotic use with a potential drive towards resistance. Several observational studies have examined whether combination therapy offers an advantage over colistin/ polymyxin monotherapy. We highlight the inherent limitations of these studies related to their observational design and sample size to show why they do not at present provide an answer to the question of combination versus monotherapy. This distinction is important to guide clinical practice until solid evidence has been obtained and to enable the recruitment of patients into randomized controlled trials. A few randomized controlled trials examining specific combinations have recently been completed or are ongoing. Currently, however, there is no evidence-based support for most combination therapies against CR-GNB, including colistin/carbapenem combination therapy.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To assess the external validity of a pragmatic, investigator-initiated RCT on treatment of severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), we compared patient characteristics and treatment effect estimates for patients included in the RCT versus those excluded. Participants and outcomes: The RCT included hospitalised patients with documented or highlyprobable invasive MRSA infections who were randomised to vancomycin versus trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) treatment, between 2007 and 2014. A concomitant observational study prospectively included all consecutive patients, between 2008 and 2011, who were excluded from the RCT due to no consent, meningitis, left-sided endocarditis, severe neutropaenia, chronic renal dialysis or treatment with study medications for longer than 48 h. The primary outcomes were clinical failure at day 7 and 30-day mortality for both studies. We compared baseline and infection characteristics, outcome rates and treatment effect estimates for included versus excluded patients.
Results: The RCT included 252 patients who were compared with 220 excluded patients who were observed. Inability to provide informed consent was the main reason for patient exclusion. Excluded patients' functional and cognitive performance was significantly poorer than that of included patients. Sepsis was more severe among excluded patients (higher rates of mechanical ventilation, indwelling catheters, septic shock and organ failure). Clinical failure occurred in 83/252 (32.9\%) versus 175/220 (79.5\%) and deaths in 32 (12.7\%) versus 64 (29.1\%) for included versus excluded patients, p{$<$}0.001 for both comparisons. Comparing vancomycin to TMPSMX, in the RCT mortality, was non-significantly lower with vancomycin (OR 0.76, 95\% CIs 0.36 to 1.62), while in the observational analysis of excluded patients, mortality was significantly higher with vancomycin (OR 2.63, 1.04 to 6.65), p=0.04 for the difference.
Conclusions: Patient characteristics, outcome event rates and treatment effects differed significantly in the setting of a RCT, despite its pragmatic design, compared to patients treated outside the trial settings.},

If several types of events occur, a model describing progression to each of these competing risks is needed. Multi-state models generalize competing risks models by also describing transitions to intermediate events. Methods to analyze such models have been developed over the last two decades. Fortunately, most of the analyzes can be performed within the standard statistical packages, but may require some extra effort with respect to data preparation and programming. This tutorial aims to review statistical methods for the analysis of competing risks and multi-state models. Although some conceptual issues are covered, the emphasis is on practical issues like data preparation, estimation of the effect of covariates, and estimation of cumulative incidence functions and state and transition probabilities. Examples of analysis with standard software are shown. Copyright q 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background. Morbidity and mortality for critically ill patients with infections remains a global healthcare problem. We aimed to determine whether {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients achieves concentrations associated with maximal activity and whether antibiotic concentrations affect patient outcome.
Methods. This was a prospective, multinational pharmacokinetic point-prevalence study including 8 {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotics. Two blood samples were taken from each patient during a single dosing interval. The primary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets were free antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogen at both 50\% (50\% f T{$>$}MIC) and 100\% (100\% f T{$>$}MIC) of the dosing interval. We used skewed logistic regression to describe the effect of antibiotic exposure on patient outcome.
Results. We included 384 patients (361 evaluable patients) across 68 hospitals. The median age was 61 (interquartile range [IQR], 48\textendash{}73) years, the median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 18 (IQR, 14\textendash{}24), and 65\% of patients were male. Of the 248 patients treated for infection, 16\% did not achieve 50\% f T{$>$}MIC and these patients were 32\% less likely to have a positive clinical outcome (odds ratio [OR], 0.68; P = .009). Positive clinical outcome was associated with increasing 50\% f T{$>$}MIC and 100\% f T{$>$}MIC ratios (OR, 1.02 and 1.56, respectively; P {$<$} .03), with significant interaction with sickness severity status.
Conclusions. Infected critically ill patients may have adverse outcomes as a result of inadeqaute antibiotic exposure; a paradigm change to more personalized antibiotic dosing may be necessary to improve outcomes for these most seriously ill patients.},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {In this Ph.D. thesis, we investigate how to optimize the design of clinical trials by constructing optimal adaptive designs, and how to implement the design by adaptive randomization. The results of the thesis are summarized by four research papers preceded by three chapters: an introduction, a short summary of the results obtained, and possible topics for future work. In Paper I, we investigate the structure of a D-optimal design for dose-finding studies with censored time-to-event outcomes. We show that the D-optimal design can be much more efficient than uniform allocation design for the parameter estimation. The D-optimal design obtained depends on true parameters of the dose-response model, so it is a locally D-optimal design. We construct two-stage and multi-stage adaptive designs as approximations of ~the D-optimal design when prior information about model parameters is not available. Adaptive designs provide very good approximations to the locally D-optimal design, and can potentially reduce total sample size in a study with a pre-specified stopping criterion. In Paper II, we investigate statistical properties of several restricted randomization procedures which target unequal allocation proportions in a multi-arm trial. We compare procedures in terms of their operational characteristics such as balance, randomness, type I error/power, and allocation ratio preserving (ARP) property. We conclude that there is no single ``best'' randomization procedure for all the target allocation proportions, but the choice of randomization can be done through computer-intensive simulations for a particular target allocation. In Paper III, we combine the results from the papers I and II to implement optimal designs in practice when the sample size is small. The simulation study done in the paper shows that the choice of randomization procedure has an impact on the quality of dose-response estimation. An adaptive design with a small cohort size should be implemented with a procedure that ensures a ``well-balanced'' allocation according to the D-optimal design at each stage. In Paper IV, we obtain an optimal design for a comparative study with unequal treatment costs and investigate its properties. We demonstrate that unequal allocation may decrease the total study cost while having the same power as traditional equal allocation. However, a larger sample size may be required. We suggest a strategy on how to choose a suitable randomization procedure which provides a good trade-off between balance and randomness to implement optimal allocation. If there is a strong linear trend in observations, then the ARP property is important to maintain the type I error and power at a certain level. Otherwise, a randomization-based inference can be a good alternative for non-ARP procedures.},

  abstract = {Empirical Bayes (``post hoc'') estimates (EBEs) of {$\eta$}s provide modelers with diagnostics: the EBEs themselves, individual prediction (IPRED), and residual errors (individual weighted residual (IWRES)). When data are uninformative at the individual level, the EBE distribution will shrink towards zero ({$\eta$}-shrinkage, quantified as 1-SD({$\eta$}EBE)/{$\omega$}), IPREDs towards the corresponding observations, and IWRES towards zero ({$\epsilon$}-shrinkage, quantified as 1-SD(IWRES)). These diagnostics are widely used in pharmacokinetic (PK) pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling; we investigate here their usefulness in the presence of shrinkage. Datasets were simulated from a range of PK PD models, EBEs estimated in nonlinear mixed effects modeling based on the true or a misspecified model, and desired diagnostics evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Identified consequences of {$\eta$}-shrinkage on EBE-based model diagnostics include non-normal and/or asymmetric distribution of EBEs with their mean values (``ETABAR'') significantly different from zero, even for a correctly specified model; EBE\textendash{}EBE correlations and covariate relationships may be masked, falsely induced, or the shape of the true relationship distorted. Consequences of {$\epsilon$}-shrinkage included low power of IPRED and IWRES to diagnose structural and residual error model misspecification, respectively. EBE-based diagnostics should be interpreted with caution whenever substantial {$\eta$}- or {$\epsilon$}-shrinkage exists (usually greater than 20\% to 30\%). Reporting the magnitude of {$\eta$}- and {$\epsilon$}-shrinkage will facilitate the informed use and interpretation of EBE-based diagnostics.},

Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.},

  abstract = {Colistin is administered as its inactive prodrug colistimethate (CMS). Selection of an individualized CMS dose for each patient is difficult due to its narrow therapeutic window, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our aim was to analyze CMS use in patients with CKD. Secondary objectives were to assess the safety and efficacy of CMS in this special population. In this prospective observational cohort study of CMS-treated CKD patients, CKD was defined as the presence of a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) {$<$} 60 mL/min/m2 for more than 3 months. The administered doses of CMS were compared with those recently published in the literature. Worsened CKD at the end of treatment (EOT) was evaluated with the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease) criteria. Colistin plasma concentrations (Css) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Fifty-nine patients were included. Thirty-six (61.2\%) were male. The median age was 76 (45\textendash{}95) years and baseline GFR was 36.6 {$\pm$} 13.6. The daily mean CMS dosage used was compared with recently recommended doses (3.36 vs. 6.07; p {$<$} 0.001). Mean Css was 0.9 (0.2\textendash{}2.9) mg/L, and Css was {$<$}2 mg/L in 50 patients (83.3\%). Clinical cure was achieved in 43 (72.9\%) patients. Worsened renal function at EOT was present in 20 (33.9\%) patients and was reversible in 10 (52.6\%). The CMS dosages used in this cohort were almost half those currently recommended. The mean achieved Css were under the recommended target of 2 mg/dL. Despite this, clinical cure rate was high. In this patient cohort, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was similar to those found in other recent studies performed in the general population and was reversible in 52.6\%. These results suggest that CMS is safe and effective in patients with CKD and may encourage physicians to adjust dosage regimens to recent recommendations in order to optimize CMS treatments.},

  abstract = {Background
Colistin has a narrow therapeutic window with nephrotoxicity being the major dose-limiting adverse effect. Currently, the optimal doses and therapeutic plasma levels are unknown.

Methods
Prospective observational cohort study, including patients infected by colistin-susceptible P. aeruginosa treated with intravenous colistimethate sodium (CMS). Clinical data and colistin plasma levels at steady-state (Css) were recorded. The primary and secondary end points were clinical cure and 30-day all-cause mortality.

Results
Ninety-one patients were included. Clinical cure was observed in 72 (79\%) patients. The mean (SD) Css was 1.49 (1.4) mg/L and 2.42 (1.5) mg/L (p\,=\,0.01) in patients who achieved clinical cure and those who not, respectively. Independent risk factors for clinical failure were male sex (OR 5.88; 95\% CI 1.09\textendash{}31.63), APACHE II score (OR 1.15; 95\% CI 1.03\textendash{}1.27) and nephrotoxicity at the EOT (OR 9.13; 95\% CI 95\% 2.06\textendash{}40.5). The 30-day mortality rate was 30.8\%. Risk factors for 30-day mortality included the APACHE II score (OR 1.98; 95\% CI 1\textendash{}1.20), the McCabe score (OR 2.49; 95\% CI 1.14\textendash{}5.43) and the presence of nephrotoxicity at the end of treatment (EOT) (OR 3.8; 95\% CI 1.26\textendash{}11.47).

Conclusion
In this series of patients with infections caused by XDR P. aeruginosa infections, Css is not~observed to be~related to clinical outcome.},

  abstract = {Background: No comprehensive systematic review of the accuracy of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement methods using renal inulin clearance as reference has been published. Study Design: Systematic review with meta-analysis of cross-sectional diagnostic studies. Setting \& Population: Published original studies and systematic reviews in any population. Selection Criteria for Studies: Index and reference measurements conducted within 48 hours; at least 15 participants studied; GFR markers measured in plasma or urine; plasma clearance calculation algorithm verified in another study; tubular secretion of creatinine had not been blocked by medicines. Index Tests: Endogenous creatinine clearance; renal or plasma clearance of chromium 512labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), iohexol, and iothalamate; and plasma clearance of inulin. Reference Test: Renal inulin clearance measured under continuous inulin infusion and urine collection.
Results: Mean bias , 10\%, median bias , 5\%, the proportion of errors in the index measurements that did not exceed 30\% (P30) \$ 80\%, and P10 \$ 50\% were set as requirements for sufficient accuracy. Based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach, the quality of evidence across studies was rated for each index method. Renal clearance of iothalamate measured GFR with sufficient accuracy (strong evidence). Renal and plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA and plasma clearance of iohexol were sufficiently accurate to measure GFR (moderately strong evidence). Renal clearance of DTPA, renal clearance of iohexol, and plasma clearance of inulin had sufficient accuracy (limited evidence). Endogenous creatinine clearance was an inaccurate method (strong evidence), as was plasma clearance of DTPA (limited evidence). The evidence to determine the accuracy of plasma iothalamate clearance was insufficient. With the exception of plasma clearance of inulin, only renal clearance methods had P30 . 90\%. Limitations: The included studies were few and most were old and small, which may limit generalizability. Requirements for sufficient accuracy may depend on clinical setting.
Conclusions: At least moderately strong evidence suggests that renal clearance of 51Cr-EDTA or iothalamate and plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA or iohexol are sufficiently accurate methods to measure GFR. Am J Kidney Dis. 64(3):411-424. \textordfeminine{} 2014 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.},

Influencing human behaviour in relation to antibiotics is a complex process which includes factors like knowledge, attitudes, social norms, socio-economic conditions, peer pressure, experiences, and bio-physical and sociobehavioural environment. Further, key concepts are often perceived in different ways by different individuals. While designing and implementing projects or programmes for behavioural change with respect to antibiotics for professionals or consumers it is helpful to consider theories or models of behaviour change, e.g. the `stages of change model', including pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. People in different stages of change are susceptible to different behaviour modification strategies. Application of marketing principles to `global good', so-called `social marketing', to improve `welfare of the individual and society' is gaining increased attention in public health. In conclusion, just providing correct knowledge is not sufficient although it is a pre-requisite for behaviour modification in the desired direction. We can never change the behaviour of any other human, but we can facilitate for others to change their own behaviour. One possibility is to implement `antibiotic mainstreaming' as a potentially effective way for behaviour modification, i.e. to address consequences for maintaining effective antibiotics in all activities and decisions in society.},

  abstract = {Background: Variation in performance of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimating equations is related to variation in calibration of the creatinine assay across clinical laboratories. Study Design: Cross-sectional analysis. Setting \& Participants: 6 research studies and 4 clinical populations including 5,504 participants who had GFR measured using urinary clearance of iothalamate.
Measurements: Standardized serum creatinine values obtained by means of calibration to the Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory using frozen specimens, a calibration panel, and/or survey results from the College of American Pathologists. Predictor: Noncalibrated serum creatinine assayed in research and clinical laboratories compared with standardized serum creatinine. Outcome: Difference between measured GFR versus GFR estimated from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study and Cockcroft-Gault equations.
Results: For a noncalibrated serum creatinine value of 1 mg/dL (88.4 ␮mol/L), standardized serum creatinine value was 0.07 mg/dL (6.2 ␮mol/L) less than noncalibrated values. In the pooled data set, for the MDRD Study equation, calibration improved median percentage of difference between measured and estimated GFR from 9.0\% (interquartile range [IQR], 28\%) to 5.8\% (IQR, 28\%) and improved the percentage of estimates within 30\% of measured GFR (P30) from 80\% to 83\%. The effect of calibration was greater at higher levels of GFR and varied across studies. For the Cockcroft-Gault equation, calibration worsened the median percentage of difference from Ϫ2.0\% (IQR, 38\%) to Ϫ11.4\% (IQR, 39\%), and the P30, from 74\% to 69\%. Limitations: College of American Pathologist samples were used for calibration of clinical populations; calibration factors do not account for drift over time in the serum creatinine assay; calibration cannot account for variation in assay performance among individuals.
Conclusion: Calibration improves the performance of the MDRD Study equation. After calibration, larger errors remain for GFR estimates greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Ͼ1 mL/s/1.73 m2). Am J Kidney Dis 50:21-35. \textcopyright{} 2007 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.},

This article tries to explore the various methods available to date, the newer concepts, and the uncared issues that may still prove to be useful in estimating renal function in intensive care unit patients. The concept of augmented renal clearance, which is frequently encountered in critically ill patients, should always be taken into account, as correct therapeutic dosage of drugs sounds vital which in turn depends on correctly calculated glomerular filtration rate. Serum creatinine and creatinine-based formulae have their own demerits that are well known and established. While Cockcroft-Gault and 4-variable modification of diet in renal diseases formulae are highly inadequate in the intensive care setup for estimating glomerular filtration rate, employing isotopic methods is impractical and cumbersome. The 6-variable modification of diet in renal diseases formula fairs better as it takes into account the serum albumin and blood urea nitrogen, too. Jelliffe's and modified Jelliffe's equations take into account the rate of creatinine production and volume of distribution which in turn fluctuates heavily in a critically ill patient. Twenty-four-hour and timed creatinine clearances offer values close to reality although not accurate and cannot provide immediate results. Cystatin C is a novel agent that offers a sure promise as it is least influenced by factors that affect serum creatinine to a major extent. Aminoglycoside clearance, although still in the dark area, may prove a simple yet precise way of estimating glomerular filtration rate in those patients in whom these drugs are therapeutically employed. Optic ratiometric method has emerged as the most sophisticated one in glomerular filtration rate estimation in critically ill patients.},

  abstract = {Combination antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative sepsis is controversial. The present review provides a brief summary of the existing knowledge on combination therapy for severe infections with multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterobacteriaceae. Empirical combination antibiotic therapy is recommended for severe sepsis and septic shock to reduce mortality related to inappropriate antibiotic treatment. Because definitive combination therapy has not been proven superior to monotherapy in meta-analyses, it is generally advised to de-escalate antibiotic therapy when the antibiotic susceptibility profile is known, although it cannot be excluded that some subgroups of patients might still benefit from continued combination therapy. Definitive combination therapy is recommended for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and should also be considered for severe infections with Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. when beta-lactams cannot be used. Because resistance to broad-spectrum beta-lactams is increasing in Gram-negative bacteria and because no new antibiotics are expected to become available in the near future, the antibacterial potential of combination therapy should be further explored. In vitro data suggest that combinations can be effective even if the bacteria are resistant to the individual antibiotics, although existing evidence is insufficient to support the choice of combinations and explain the synergistic effects observed. In vitro models can be used to screen for effective combinations that can later be validated in animal or clinical studies. Further, in the absence of clinical evidence, in vitro data might be useful in supporting therapeutic decisions for severe infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.},

Unfortunately, universally accepted endpoints for the evaluation of new drugs in severe infections are lacking.
Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We review and discuss the current practices and challenges regarding endpoints in RCTs in this field and propose novel approaches.
Results:\hspace{0.6em} Usual endpoints actually recommended for drug development suffer from important flaws. Mortality requires large sample size and only partly related to the infectious process. Clinical cure rate is highly subjective in critically ill patients where symptoms may be related to other intercurrent events. Currently, composite endpoints, hierarchical nested designs, and competing risks analysis seem to be the most promising new tools for designing and analyzing clinical trials in this area, although they require further validation.
Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical companies, and clinicians need to agree on the most appropri-ate clinical endpoints for severe infections to ensure efficient approval of new, effective antibiotic agents.},

There is a need to tackle antibiotic resistance emergence and containment on levels ranging from individuals, households, and the communities, to health care facilities, the entire health sector, and finally to national and global levels. We analyse emergence of antibiotic resistance based on interdependencies between health systems resources. We further go beyond the health system building blocks, to look at determinants of antibiotic resistance referring to wider global dynamics. Multi-level governance is the key for successful action in containment strategies. This will involve, in a comprehensive way, patients, health facilities where they receive care, health systems to which these facilities pertain, and the wider national context as well as the global community that influences the functioning of these health systems. In order to be effective and sustainable in both high and low-resource settings, implementation of containment interventions at all these levels needs to be managed based on existing theories and models of change. Although ministries of health and the global community must provide vision and support, it is important to keep in mind that containment interventions for antibiotic resistance will target individuals, consumers as well as providers.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) carbapenemase (KPC)-producing strains of Kp have become a significant threat in recent years. To assess their outcomes and identify risk factors for 14 day mortality, we conducted a 4 year (2010\textendash{} 13) retrospective cohort study in five large Italian teaching hospitals.
Methods: The cohort included 661 adults with bloodstream infections (BSIs; n{$\frac{1}{4}$} 447) or non-bacteraemic infections (lower respiratory tract, intra-abdominal structure, urinary tract or other sites) caused by a KPC-Kp isolate. All had received {$\geq$}48 h of therapy (empirical and/or non-empirical) with at least one drug to which the isolate was susceptible.
Results: Most deaths occurred within 2 weeks of infection onset (14 day mortality: 225/661, 34.1\%). Logistic regression analysis identified BSI (OR, 2.09; 95\% CI, 1.34 \textendash{}3.29), presentation with septic shock (OR, 2.45; 95\% CI, 1.47 \textendash{}4.08), inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy (OR, 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.01 \textendash{}2.18), chronic renal failure (OR, 2.27; 95\% CI, 1.44\textendash{}3.58), high APACHE III score (OR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 1.04 \textendash{}1.07) and colistin-resistant isolates (OR, 2.18; 95\% CI, 1.37 \textendash{}3.46) as independent predictors of 14 day mortality. Combination therapy with at least two drugs displaying in vitro activity against the isolate was associated with lower mortality (OR, 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.35 \textendash{}0.77), in particular in patients with BSIs, lung infections or high APACHE III scores and/or septic shock at infection onset. Combinations that included meropenem were associated with significantly higher survival rates when the KPC-Kp isolate had a meropenem MIC of {$\leq$}8 mg/L.
Conclusions: KPC-Kp infections are associated with high mortality. Treatment with two or more drugs displaying activity against the isolate improves survival, mainly in patients who are critically ill.},

Generally, large amounts of clinical data are available prior to the start of a study, particularly on the current study's control arm. There is obvious appeal in using (i.e., `borrowing') this information. With historical data providing information on the control arm, more trial resources can be devoted to the novel treatment while retaining accurate estimates of the current control arm parameters. This can result in more accurate point estimates, increased power, and reduced type I error in clinical trials, provided the historical information is sufficiently similar to the current control data. If this assumption of similarity is not satisfied, however, one can acquire increased mean square error of point estimates due to bias and either reduced power or increased type I error depending on the direction of the bias. In this manuscript, we review several methods for historical borrowing, illustrating how key parameters in each method affect borrowing behavior, and then, we compare these methods on the basis of mean square error, power and type I error. We emphasize two main themes. First, we discuss the idea of `dynamic' (versus `static') borrowing. Second, we emphasize the decision process involved in determining whether or not to include historical borrowing in terms of the perceived likelihood that the current control arm is sufficiently similar to the historical data. Our goal is to provide a clear review of the key issues involved in historical borrowing and provide a comparison of several methods useful for practitioners.},

This paper provides a detailed derivation of the objective functions for the most commonly used estimation methods in NONMEM, such as the Laplacian method, the first-order conditional estimation method (FOCE) with or without interaction, and the first-order method (FO). In addition, models with homogenous or heterogeneous residual error were used to demonstrate the relationship between the objective functions derived from two different types of approximation, namely Laplacian approximation of log-likelihood and linearized model approximation. The relationship between these estimation methods and those implemented in SAS and Splus is discussed.},

  abstract = {Rating and composite scales are commonly used to assess treatment efficacy. The two main strategies for modelling such endpoints are to treat them as a continuous or an ordered categorical variable (CV or OC). Both strategies have disadvantages, including making assumptions that violate the integer nature of the data (CV) and requiring many parameters for scales with many response categories (OC). We present a method, called the bounded integer (BI) model, which utilises the probit function with fixed cut-offs to estimate the probability of a certain score through a latent variable. This method was successfully implemented to describe six data sets from four different therapeutic areas: Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and neuropathic pain. Five scales were investigated, ranging from 11 to 181 categories. The fit (likelihood) was better for the BI model than for corresponding OC or CV models ({$\Delta$}AIC range 11\textendash{}1555) in all cases but one ({$\Delta$}AIC - 63), while the number of parameters was the same or lower. Markovian elements were successfully implemented within the method. The performance in external validation, assessed through cross-validation, was also in favour of the new model ({$\Delta$}OFV range 22\textendash{}1694) except in one case ({$\Delta$}OFV - 70). A residual for diagnostic purposes is discussed. This study shows that the BI model respects the integer nature of data and is parsimonious in terms of number of estimated parameters.},

They are suitable for both biomedical and other applications in which time-toevent variables are analyzed. However, they are still not frequently applied. So far, an important reason for this has been the lack of available software. To overcome this problem, we have developed the mstate package in R for the analysis of multi-state models. The package covers all steps of the analysis of multi-state models, from model building and data preparation to estimation and graphical representation of the results. It can be applied to non- and semi-parametric (Cox) models. The package is also suitable for competing risks models, as they are a special category of multi-state models.},

  abstract = {Covariate analysis based on population pharmacokinetics (PPK) is used to identify clinically relevant factors. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) based on nonlinear mixed effect model fits is currently recommended for covariate identification, whereas individual empirical Bayesian estimates (EBEs) are considered unreliable due to the presence of shrinkage. The objectives of this research were to investigate the type I error for LRT and EBE approaches, to confirm the similarity of power between the LRT and EBE approaches from a previous report and to explore the influence of shrinkage on LRT and EBE inferences. Using an oral one-compartment PK model with a single covariate impacting on clearance, we conducted a wide range of simulations according to a two-way factorial design. The results revealed that the EBE-based regression not only provided almost identical power for detecting a covariate effect, but also controlled the false positive rate better than the LRT approach. Shrinkage of EBEs is likely not the root cause for decrease in power or inflated false positive rate although the size of the covariate effect tends to be underestimated at high shrinkage. In summary, contrary to the current recommendations, EBEs may be a better choice for statistical tests in PPK covariate analysis compared to LRT. We proposed a threestep covariate modeling approach for population PK analysis to utilize the advantages of EBEs while overcoming their shortcomings, which allows not only markedly reducing the run time for population PK analysis, but also providing more accurate covariate tests.},

Efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to screen for and design novel antibacterials have not been successful, with several companies minimizing or closing down their antibacterial research units, leading to a loss of skills and know-how. At the same time, antibiotic innovation in academia is not filling the void due to misaligned incentive structures and lack of vital knowledge of drug discovery. The scientific and structural difficulties in discovering new antibiotics have only begun to be appreciated in the latest years. Part of the problem has been a paradigm shift within both industry and academia to focus on `rational' drug development with an emphasis on single targets and high-throughput screening of large chemical libraries, which may not be suited to target bacteria. The very particular aspects of `targeting an organism inside another organism' have not been given enough attention. In this paper, researcher interviews have complemented literature studies to delve deeper into the specifics of the different scientific and structural barriers, and some potential solutions are offered.},
