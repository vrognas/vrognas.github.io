      <title>Software management with Homebrew üç∫</title>

      <description>One thing that GNU/Linux users are familiar with is the concept of a ‚Äúpackage manager‚Äù. A package manager is a tool that keeps track of software for you. It installs it, uninstalls it, upgrades it, etc. On macOS there isn‚Äôt any package manager installed by default (perhaps the App Store could be seen as some form of package manager?), so for all you macOS users out there I highly recommend you install Homebrew.</description>

      <title>Cheat for the command line!</title>

      <description>When you start out using the command line, you will notice that there are many small and handy programs (also referred to as ‚Äúcommands‚Äù) you can run. You might start out using pwd (for ‚Äúprint working directory‚Äù), which will tell you what directory you are currently in. Then you might use programs such as ls to ‚Äúlist‚Äù the contents of a directory, and you might use cd to ‚Äúchange directory‚Äù to another directory you might want to go to.</description>

      <title>My view on estimating kidney function in pharmacometrics</title>

      <description>In pharmacometric practice we often use some formula to estimate kidney function. Most often the Cockcroft-Gault1 (CG) formula is used. Other formulas used include MDRD2 (6- or 4-variable versions) and the CKD-EPI.3
These equations differ in how they were developed, in what population, and what they estimate! Something to keep in mind is that CG estimates creatinine clearance, while the CKD-EPI and MDRD estimate GFR. Both CKD-EPI and MDRD are also adjusted for body surface area4 (BSA), which CG is not.</description>

      <description>Bonjour!
So I recently attended the yearly R conference called useR! It was a great experience to attend presentations of the developers of many packages that I have been using. I especially enjoyed hearing Hadley Wickham (tidyverse/dplyr/ggplot2), Lionel Henry (rlang/tidy-eval), Romain Fran√ßois (dplyr), Terry Therneau (survival) and Achim Zeileis (colorspace).
Lionel Henry‚Äôs talk got me inspired to learn more about tidy-eval and how it is used to write functions in the tidyverse!</description>

      <title>Touch Typing</title>

      <description>It all started out with me trying to learn Vim I came across the term ‚Äútouch typing‚Äù when I was looking in a book about Vim (the text editor). The book is called Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought, by Drew Neil. In there I read the following in the foreword:
 Learn to Touch Type, Then Learn Vim
If you have to look down to find the keys on the keyboard, the benefits of learning Vim won‚Äôt come fast.</description>
