      <description>In pharmacometric practice we often use some formula to estimate kidney function. Most often the Cockcroft-Gault1 (CG) formula is used. Other formulas used include MDRD2 (6- or 4-variable versions) and the CKD-EPI.3
These equations differ in how they were developed, in what population, and what they estimate! Something to keep in mind is that CG estimates creatinine clearance, while the CKD-EPI and MDRD estimate GFR. Both CKD-EPI and MDRD are also adjusted for body surface area4 (BSA), which CG is not.</description>
