      <description>For your report, use the official university template if one exists. Think about how you will analyze your results before you have the results. Don’t follow the instructions from your supervisor blindly. Make sure you understand the reasoning behind the decisions. If you don’t understand why you do things a certain way, ask. When you present your work, you don’t want to answer any questions with “because my supervisor said so”.</description>

      <description>Bonjour!
So I recently attended the yearly R conference called useR! It was a great experience to attend presentations of the developers of many packages that I have been using. I especially enjoyed hearing Hadley Wickham (tidyverse/dplyr/ggplot2), Lionel Henry (rlang/tidy-eval), Romain François (dplyr), Terry Therneau (survival) and Achim Zeileis (colorspace).
Lionel Henry’s talk got me inspired to learn more about tidy-eval and how it is used to write functions in the tidyverse!</description>

      <description>It all started out with me trying to learn Vim I came across the term “touch typing” when I was looking in a book about Vim (the text editor). The book is called Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought, by Drew Neil. In there I read the following in the foreword:
 Learn to Touch Type, Then Learn Vim
If you have to look down to find the keys on the keyboard, the benefits of learning Vim won’t come fast.</description>
