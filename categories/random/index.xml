      <description>Bonjour!
So I recently attended the yearly R conference called useR! It was a great experience to attend presentations of the developers of many packages that I have been using. I especially enjoyed hearing Hadley Wickham (tidyverse/dplyr/ggplot2), Lionel Henry (rlang/tidy-eval), Romain François (dplyr), Terry Therneau (survival) and Achim Zeileis (colorspace).
Lionel Henry’s talk got me inspired to learn more about tidy-eval and how it is used to write functions in the tidyverse!</description>

      <description>It all started out with me trying to learn Vim I came across the term “touch typing” when I was looking in a book about Vim (the text editor). The book is called Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought, by Drew Neil. In there I read the following in the foreword:
 Learn to Touch Type, Then Learn Vim
If you have to look down to find the keys on the keyboard, the benefits of learning Vim won’t come fast.</description>
