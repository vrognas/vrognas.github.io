      <description>One thing that GNU/Linux users are familiar with is the concept of a ‚Äúpackage manager‚Äù. A package manager is a tool that keeps track of software for you. It installs it, uninstalls it, upgrades it, etc. On macOS there isn‚Äôt any package manager installed by default (perhaps the App Store could be seen as some form of package manager?), so for all you macOS users out there I highly recommend you install Homebrew.</description>

      <description>When you start out using the command line, you will notice that there are many small and handy programs (also referred to as ‚Äúcommands‚Äù) you can run. You might start out using pwd (for ‚Äúprint working directory‚Äù), which will tell you what directory you are currently in. Then you might use programs such as ls to ‚Äúlist‚Äù the contents of a directory, and you might use cd to ‚Äúchange directory‚Äù to another directory you might want to go to.</description>
